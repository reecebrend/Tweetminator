# Tweetminator

Tweetminator: Rise of the Bots is a final year project researched and developed by Reece Brend. 
The aim of the system is to create an open source software to determine whether or not a Twitter user is a bot,
based on some pre-defined characteristics. Although this is the main objective of the project, 
the scope may be altered along the way depending upon the complexity of the task at hand.
